# Mars Rover Test List

## âœ… Completed Features
- [x] Turn left (L) - single command
- [x] Turn right (R) - single command  
- [x] Multiple turn commands (e.g., "LL", "RR", "LR")
- [x] Test all direction transitions:
  - [x] Left: Nâ†’Wâ†’Sâ†’Eâ†’N (LLLL test)
  - [x] Right: Nâ†’Eâ†’Sâ†’Wâ†’N (RRRR test)
- [x] Move forward (F) - single step in current direction
  - [x] North movement (y+1)
  - [x] East movement (x+1)  
  - [x] South movement (y-1)
  - [x] West movement (x-1)
- [x] Move backward (B) - single step opposite to current direction
  - [x] North â†’ South movement (y-1)
  - [x] East â†’ West movement (x-1)
  - [x] South â†’ North movement (y+1)
  - [x] West â†’ East movement (x+1)

## âœ… Combined Movement Commands (Completed)

1. [x] [TEST] Forward then backward should return to original position and direction
2. [x] [TEST] Two forward moves should advance two positions in same direction
3. [x] [TEST] Complex movement sequence FRBLFRBL validates comprehensive command handling

## âœ… Test Cleanup Completed
- âœ… Deleted redundant individual movement tests (F/B per direction)
- âœ… Retained comprehensive combined movement tests with superior coverage
- âœ… Maintained full regression protection with fewer, better tests

## ðŸš§ Future Features

### Edge Cases and Validation  
- [ ] Invalid commands (ignore unknown characters)
- [ ] Empty command string
- [ ] Case sensitivity (if applicable)
- [ ] Very long command strings

### Advanced Features (Future)
- [ ] Grid boundaries and wrapping
- [ ] Obstacle detection and stopping
- [ ] Position reporting/status query
- [ ] Multiple rovers on same grid
- [ ] Rover state persistence

## Test Strategy Notes
- Follow strict TDD: Red â†’ Green â†’ Refactor
- One failing test at a time
- Minimal implementation to pass tests
- Refactor only when all tests are green
